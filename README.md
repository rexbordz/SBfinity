**SBfinity** is a lightweight browser-based integration that connects [Streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot/) and [TikFinity](https://tikfinity.zerody.one/app/) in real time. It listens to TikTok events via TikFinity and triggers **Custom Triggers** inside Streamer.bot — making it easy for streamers to handle TikTok events using their familiar Streamer.bot setup.

> ⚠️ Note: SBfinity does not replace TikFinity’s built-in automation features. It simply exposes basic TikTok event triggers to Streamer.bot as custom triggers. SBfinity cannot execute TikFinity’s internal actions — it’s designed only for streamers who prefer handling all logic and effects from within Streamer.bot.
