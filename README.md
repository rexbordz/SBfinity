# SBfinity

**SBfinity** is a lightweight browser-based integration that connects [Streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot) and [TikFinity]([https://github.com/zerodytrash/TikFinity](https://tikfinity.zerody.one/app/)) in real time. It listens to events from TikTok via TikFinity and sends them to Streamer.bot as **Custom Triggers**, so you can build actions in Streamer.bot for TikTok interactions ‚Äî a great tool for those who are more comfortable with using [Streamer.Bot].

## üîå Requirements

- [Streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot)
- [TikFinity Desktop App](https://tikfinity.zerody.one/app/)

     - Go to `Streamer.bot > Settings > Websocket Server`.
     - ‚úÖ Check **Enable Websocket Server**
     - No need to change host or port (keep default `ws://localhost:8080`)

3. **Import Custom Triggers**
   - In Streamer.bot, go to `Actions > Import` and paste this:
     ```
     [Insert Import String or .sb file link here]
     ```
   - Restart Streamer.Bot after importing to see the changes.

4. **Add the Browser Source in OBS (or any broadcasting software you use that allows adding a browser source)**
   - Add this URL as a **browser source** in OBS to any scene:
     ```
     https://rexbordz.github.io/sbfinity/
     ```
   - ‚ùå DO NOT enable `Shutdown source when not visible` or else it will cause some problems.

5. ‚úÖ You're all set!
   - When TikFinity and Streamer.bot are running, SBfinity will connect to both.
